# AP-Statistics-CalculatoR

The purpose of this project is to make a simple calculator program using R that will include all of the calculator functions that are covered in AP Statistics. The full project is in the file **CALCULATOR.R**, while the other projects are older versions of the full projects or other other random stat files. To run the file with user input, click the **Source** button to the top right of the RStudio screen. The following functions are used in the program: 

* BinomialPDF
* BinomialCDF
* GeometPDF
* GeometCDF
* NormalCDF
* InvNorm
* ZInterval
* 1-PropZInterval
* 2-PropZInterval
* 1-PropZTest
* 2-PropZTest
* T-Test
* 2-SampleTTest
* TInterval
* InvT
* Tcdf
* χ²-GOF
* χ²-Test
* LinReg<br>
* LinRegTTest
* LinRegTInt
* 1-VarStat
* 2-VarStats
