# AP-Statistics-CalculatoR

The purpose of this project is to make a simple calculator program using R that will include all of the calculator functions that we covered in AP Statistics. The full project is in the file CALCULATOR.R, while the other projects are older versions of the full projects or other other random stat files. The following functions are used in the program: 

BinomialPDF
BinomialCDF
