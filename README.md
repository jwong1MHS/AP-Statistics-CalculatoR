# AP-Statistics-CalculatoR

The purpose of this project is to make a simple calculator program using R that will include all of the calculator functions that we covered in AP Statistics. The full project is in the file **CALCULATOR.R**, while the other projects are older versions of the full projects or other other random stat files. Top run the file with user input, click the **Source** button to the top right of the RStudio screen next to the **Run** button. However, users do not have to use the command line user prompt, but instead can fiddle around with the variables and numbers that were commented and nested within the 600 lines of code. The following functions are used in the program: 

BinomialPDF<br>
BinomialCDF<br>
GeometPDF<br>
GeometCDF<br>
NormalCDF<br>
InvNorm<br>
ZInterval<br>
1-PropZInterval<br>
2-PropZInterval<br>
1-PropZTest<br>
2-PropZTest<br>
T-Test<br>
2-SampleTTest<br>
TInterval<br>
InvT<br>
Tcdf<br>
X2-GOF<br>
X2-Test<br>
LinReg<br>
LinRegTTest<br>
LinRegTInt<br>
1-VarStat<br>
2-VarStats<br>
