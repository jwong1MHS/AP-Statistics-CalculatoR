# AP-Statistics-CalculatoR

The purpose of this project is to make a simple calculator program using R that will include all of the calculator functions that we covered in AP Statistics, such as one-sample and two-sample confidence interviala and hypothesis tests for z distributions, t distributions, and chi-squared distributions, as well as linear regressions.
